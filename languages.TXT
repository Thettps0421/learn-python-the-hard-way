
I call them “features” here (these little things you import to make your
Python program do more) but nobody else calls them features. I just used that
name because I needed to trick you into learning what they are without
jargon. Before you can continue, you need to learn their real name: modules.
From now on we will be calling these “features” that we import modules. I’ll
say things like, “You want to import the sys module.” They are also called
“libraries” by other programmers, but let’s just stick with modules.
What You Should See
Warning!
Pay attention! You have been running python scripts without command line
arguments. If you type only python3.6 ex13.py you are doing it wrong! Pay
close attention to how I run it. This applies any time you see argv being used.
